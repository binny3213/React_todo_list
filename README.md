### About :
created a sleek and functional to-do list application using React.<br>
This app allows users to effortlessly add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, all within a clean and intuitive interface.<br>
Leveraging Reactâ€™s powerful state management with hooks like useState, I ensured the app is highly responsive and dynamic.
